        <h2>Approaching the island</h2>
        <p>The island appeared smaller on the horizon, but as we approach I can see
        houses built up into a small mountainside.  There are only a few docks, because
        of the rocky shores.  Along the eastern side of the island are cliffs.
        We hear faint music, as if the locals are engaged in a festival.  It seems
        like the perfect time to sneak in.</p>
        <h2>The crew noisily plays cards on the deck, a few are clearly drunk.</h2>
        <p>We have two options.</p>
        <p>We wait until nightfall, row up to the docks and sneak
          under them.  Perhaps everyone will be tired from the festivities or too
          distracted to notice a few pirates.<p/>
        <p>Alternatively, we could take advantage of the festivities and threaten
        the village with our swords while everyone is all in one place.  Hopefully they
        have less guards ready on such a celebratory day.  To do this, we sould sail boldy
        to the docks and move quickly, fighting off villagers if we need to.</p>
